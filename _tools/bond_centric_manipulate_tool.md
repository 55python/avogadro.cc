![]({{ page.image }}) The bond-centric manipulation tool provides a "chemically-oriented" way to change bond lengths, angles, and dihedral angles.

-   Click on a bond. A rectangle will be drawn with the bond at the center. You can rotate this plane about the bond by clicking on the bond and dragging.
-   Right click on one of the atoms in the selected bond and drag to change the bond length. The current bond length is listed in the bottom left corner.
-   Left click on one of the atoms in the selected bond and drag to change the bond angle. The atom you click on will move in the highlighted plane, with the other atom as the center of rotation. The appropriate angles will update interactively.
-   Click on an atom neighboring the bond and drag to change the dihedral angle. The dihedral measurements update interactively.

The plane used for angle manipulation can be changed. Click on the bond and drag to change the orientation.

-   The "Snap-to Bonds" (and Snap-to Threshold) will set whether the angle plane will "snap" when close to a neighboring bond.
