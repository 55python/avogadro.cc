Task
----

Build and minimize simple molecules to illustrate VSEPR geometry.

-   For organic-type molecules, use the MMFF94 forcefield.

examples: methane, water, ammonia, etc.

-   For octahedral-based geometries, use the UFF forcefield which is optimized for all elements.

examples: SF6, IF5, XeF4, etc.

Issues
------

-   Geometries derived from the trigonal bipyramidal geometry are not currently reliable.
-   When using the Draw tool, you may wish to uncheck the "Adjust Hydrogens" box.
