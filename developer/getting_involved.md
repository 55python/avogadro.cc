Avogadro has a very open and active development community. Currently there are more than 10 active developers and other various contributers.

We are all volunteers and appreciate any and all contributions towards making Avogadro a better program.

How to Help
-----------

-   Tell your friends
-   Write [documentation](documentation "wikilink") for this wiki

-   Send us some example files and fragment
-   [Report bugs](http://sourceforge.net/p/avogadro/bugs/) you encounter

-   Help with coding: [Projects](To Do "wikilink")

Even non-programmers can help out! There is a strong need for documentation, tutorials, context help, and translation:

-   Write [Tutorials](Tutorials "wikilink") for the Wiki
-   Addition of context tooltips to tools, engines, misc GUI elements, etc.
-   Find poorly documented classes from the API docs and ask about them: [API](http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/api/dev/)
