# AutoRotate Tool

![](Autorotate.png "fig:Autorotate.png") The AutoRotate tool allows you to continuously rotate a molecule in space, e.g. for a presentation.

There are two ways to set the rotation:

-   Click and drag anywhere in the molecule window - this will draw a red line. The direction of the line will determine the direction of rotation and the length of the line will determine the rate of rotation. The longer the line, the faster the rotation. Rotation will start as soon as you release the mouse button.
-   Drag a slider to rotate along the x, y, or z axis. Move the slider to the right to rotate clockwise, move it to the left to rotate counter-clockwise. The farther you move the slider, the faster the rotation.

<!-- -->

-   Click "Stop" to end rotation.
-   Click "Start" to restart rotation.
-   Click the "Reset" button, or click anywhere in the molecule window, to stop rotation and reset the direction.
