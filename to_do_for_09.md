# To Do For 0.9

This is a rough list of things that we must get done in order to make a 0.9 alpha release. I think mainly listing show stoppers here would be useful, and feature extensions that would be nice might also make sense.

Website
-------

-   Updated screenshots
-   Tutorials

Windows build
-------------

-   Add a way to inform the user there was an error in a python engine/tool through the Messages **(done)**
-   Test translations

Show Stoppers
-------------

Porting to the new API:

-   Bond Centric Tool. **(done)**
-   GAMESS input. **(done)**
-   Unit Cells. **(done)**
-   Animation extension.
-   Dipole engine.

Enhancements
------------

-   Clean up the generation of meshes and cubes - into the orbital extension/another extension. **(mostly done)**
-   Clean up the API for consistency and documentation. **(most of the way there)**
-   New languages from Launchpad
