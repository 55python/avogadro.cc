# Display

Display types (or rendering engines) change the way you visualize your molecular data.

In Avogadro, objects like atoms and bonds can be part of multiple displays -- each can overlay on top of the rest. This allows for transparency and a variety of display options.

There is also a [gallery](Display Gallery "wikilink") of the different display types.
