Task
----

Build and minimize isomeric alkenes and compare their relative energies to confirm empirical rules for evaluating alkene stability: Zaitsef's rule, cis vs trans, isolate vs conjugated dienes.

Examples:

-   Compare: 1-hexene, 2-hexene (cis and trans), 2-methyl-2-pentene, 2,3-dimethyl-2-butene
-   Compare: 1,4-pentadiene and 1,3-pentadiene
