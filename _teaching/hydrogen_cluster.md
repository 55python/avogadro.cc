Task
----

Create 7 molecules of hydrogen. Run optimization and correct figure until all molecules are standing in a flat hexagonal order. Check the energy of interaction and distance between molecules.

-   Space group: P63/mmc (Space group number: 194)
-   Structure: hcp (hexagonal close-packed).

Issues
------

Melting of this cluster is poorely controllable.

Cluster is a bit deformed, with long optimization some molecules tend to rotate and stand skew to neighbours.

Given configuration differs greatly from one shown at [2](http://webelements.com/hydrogen/crystal_structure.html). I can see no cause for it, so it's possible that webelements has wrong picture.
