Investigate atom geometries using VSEPR rules.

Task
----

Build and minimize simple molecules to illustrate VSEPR geometry.

-   For organic-type molecules, use the MMFF94 forcefield.

examples: methane, water, ammonia, etc.

-   For octahedral-based geometries, use the UFF forcefield which is optimized for all elements.

examples: $$\ce{SF6}$$, $$\ce{IF5}$$, $$\ce{XeF4}$$, etc.

- Try even 7, 8, or 9 atoms around a central metal - how do the VSEPR rules extend beyond octahedral molecules?

Issues
------

-   Geometries derived from the trigonal bipyramidal geometry are not currently reliable.
-   When using the Draw tool, you may wish to uncheck the "Adjust Hydrogens" box.
