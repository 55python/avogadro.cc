Documentation for Avogadro is spread over several sections, including tutorials and walk-throughs, plus more detailed descriptions of each tool, menu, command, and display type:

-  [Tutorials](/tutorials/) & Step-by-Step Walk-throughs
-  [Tools](/tools/)
-  [Commands & Extensions](/commands/)
-  [Display Types & Rendering](/rendering/)
-  [Scripting](/python/)

Documentation is relatively limited at present. If you don't find what you need you should consider posting your question to the [Avogadro discussion group](contact.html).
