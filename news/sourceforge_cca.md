**1. Complete this sentence in about 140 characters: "Our project is [-foo-]." For example, "Our project is a tool that helps you wash your car."**

Avogadro is an advanced molecular editor with interactive simulations. It offers flexible rendering and a powerful plugin architecture. (136 chars)

Avogadro is an advanced, cross platform, 3-dimensional molecular editor. It offers flexible rendering and a powerful plugin architecture. (138 chars) -- Vote: Tim, Geoff

**2. Complete this sentence, also in about 140 characters: "We should win because [-bar-]." For example, "We should win because we have a strong community and we solve a universal problem."**

Avogadro advances the state of the art in chemistry education. It offers an intuitive, flexible tool for building dynamic 3D molecular models. (143 chars)

Avogadro advances the state of the art in chemistry education. It brings dynamic 3D molecular models to students and scientists worldwide. (139 chars) -- Vote: Tim, Geoff

Avogadro is an open project, bringing together developers and users from various chemistry related areas ranging from high school students to university professors. (165 chars)

We should win because Avogadro advances the state of the art in chemistry education, offering a localized, scriptable, extensible framework to educators. (154 chars)

**3. Please provide a logo (or screenshot, if you'd prefer) for your project. It should be at least 640x480, but we'll also be showing it as a thumbnail.**

Are we going to use a screenshot or a more artistic image showing orbitals, cartoon proteins and crystals?

`I vote for artistic image -- say a raytraced combination of a nanotube, protein, and maybe orbitals?`
`I vote for a raytraced image of something like benzene --carsten`
`I also like the idea of a ray traced orbital --Marcus`
`I've send some protein images to Geoff and Marcus. They don't have to be included though --Tim`

**4. This one is optional, but it could make a big difference. We'd like to show our voters a video that introduces them to the core members of your team. Send along the URL (on YouTube) and we'll make sure they see it!**

`We should try to do this. If people record some clips, I'll put together the full video. --Geoff`
`OK - I put a short clip up where Geoff can get at it --Marcus`
`I don't have a camera --Tim`

**5. In some cases, I'm mailing several people in your community because I don't know who the right person is. If you're not the right person for me to be dealing with, please let me know. I certainly don't want to be irritating.**

Should we choose someone to do the communication?

I think any of us can do this, but maybe Marcus, Geoff, and Tim as the longest-serving developers?

**6. Our finalists are usually pretty interesting people. Are you willing to be contacted by our public relations team about interviews with the press?**

Of course!
