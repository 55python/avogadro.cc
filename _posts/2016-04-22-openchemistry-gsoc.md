Avogadro and [Open Chemistry](http://openchemistry.org) are part of Google Summer of Code 2016.
We would like to congratulate Reinis, Patrick, and Sanjeed for 3 excellent project proposals:

https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/organizations/6038224459792384/

- Reinis Danne - Python scripting support for Avogadro 2
- Patrick Avery - Materials science advances for Avogadro 2
- Sanjeed Schamnad - Integration of cclib using Chemical JSON

I think I speak for everyone that weâ€™re excited to see more progress on Avogadro 2 this summer - and hopefully the first official release of Avogadro 2.0 this fall.
