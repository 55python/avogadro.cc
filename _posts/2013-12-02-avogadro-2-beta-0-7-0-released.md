We are very proud to announce the availability of Avogadro 2, Beta 0.7.0.

Avogadro 2 is a free, open source, cross-platform molecular editor
designed for flexible use in computational chemistry, molecular
modeling, bioinformatics, materials science, and related
areas. Packages are available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. The
source code source is available under the 3-clause BSD license.

Avogadro 2 is a rewrite of Avogadro, with a completely new rendering
engine. It is capable of significantly faster performance, viewing and
editing thousands and millions of atoms, and with improved stability
and extensibility.

At the moment, Avogadro 2 is still considered in beta, and still lacks
features present in Avogadro 1.x. Both packages can be installed on
the same system, so it is possible to try the latest without losing
access to the previous version. We will be making occasional releases of
Avogadro 1.x too, along with migrating functionality to Avogadro 2. We
value your feedback, and hope that you will find the improvements made
in version 2 useful.

**What does Avogadro 2 do?**

* We've tried to make the best, most intuitive "builder"
* Dramatically improved rendering, with better graphical quality, and
  faster performance.
* Interfaces to many common computational packages
* Designed to help both educational users and advanced research
* Plugins that allow it to be extended and customized
* Can be extended with simple Python scripts for file IO and input generation
* Well defined public API, libraries and modular design

Army SBIR with the Engineering Research Development Center under
contract (W912HZ-12-C-0005) at Kitware, Inc.
