Add Hydrogens for pH...
-----------------------

Will add or remove acidic hydrogens according to the desired pH.

Only (?) affects ionizable groups in peptides: carboxylic acid, amine, imidazole, guanidine, phenol.

Guanidine and phenol don't seem to be affected when not part of a peptide.

Remove Hydrogens
----------------

Insert

#### Fragment ...

-   Choose a molecule to insert from the fragment library.

You may need to navigate to the share/avogadro/fragments directory first (Windows)

-   Select the folder containing the functional group you want to add.
-   Click the desired molecule.
-   Click the Insert Fragment button.
-   Close the fragment window by clicking the X in the top right corner.

You can add more than one fragment at a time. Caution: each fragment will appear in the center of the window, you will have to move them to prevent the molecules overlapping one another.

#### SMILES...

Type a SMILES string into the textbox and click OK

#### Peptide...

Opens the peptide builder window.

You can build peptides from the 20 standard amino acids by either clicking the buttons or typing the three-letter codes for the desired amino acids separated by hyphens. The one-letter codes are not understood by the builder.

For example: Gly-Ala-Cys

Additional settings are available for:

-   Structure: straight chain, Alpha helix, beta sheet, other
-   Phi and Psi angles
-   Stereochemistry: D or L
-   Ionization state of the C- and N-termini
