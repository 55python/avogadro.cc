# Draw Tool

![](Draw.png "fig:Draw.png") The draw tool is the principal way to build molecules.

-   You can select the element to use in a drop down menu. The "Other" option will bring up a full periodic table.
-   The bond order (single, double, or triple) can be set in a drop down menu.
-   The "adjust hydrogens" option will attempt to add or delete hydrogen atoms to fill normal valence.

<!-- -->

-   Right click on an atom or bond to delete it.

If you change elements and click on an existing atom, the new element will replace the old. Similarly, if you click on an existing bond, you will change the type from single to double to triple and back to single.

You can type element symbols to change to that element, or type 1, 2, or 3 to change the bond type to single, double, or triple bonds.
