# Manipulate Tool

![](Manipulate.png "fig:Manipulate.png") The manipulate tool allows you to move individual atoms or selected fragments in space.

-   Left click and drag: Translate atoms or fragments in space.
-   Middle click: Push atoms or fragments through space (up and down relative to the screen).
-   Right click and drag: Rotate atoms or fragments in space (only does something when at least one atom is selected).

If a set of atoms is [selected](Select Tool "wikilink"), then the entire set will be manipulated together. This is an effective way to move fragments into position.
