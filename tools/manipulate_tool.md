![]({{ page.image }}) The manipulate tool allows you to move individual atoms or selected fragments in space.

-   **Left click and drag**: Translate atoms or fragments in space.
-   **Middle click**: Push atoms or fragments through space (up and down relative to the screen).
-   **Right click and drag**: Rotate atoms or fragments in space (only does something when at least one atom is selected).

If a set of atoms is [selected](select_tool.html), then the entire set will be manipulated together. This is an effective way to move fragments into position.
