# Developer

You can extend and develop with Avogadro in many ways. Most of the functionality is contained in the libavogadro library, which can be embedded into C++ or Python programs. You can also extend the functionality of Avogadro and Libavogadro with new plugins and scripts.

Development can use C++ or [Python Scripting](Scripting "wikilink")

For ideas, we have a section on [Inspiration](Inspiration "wikilink")

The API documentation also has a set of [Tutorial Extensions](http://avogadro.openmolecules.net/api/dev/tpe-toc.html)
