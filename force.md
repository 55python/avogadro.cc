# Force

The force display can be used in combination with geometry optimization.

If you have performed molecular mechanics optimization, the display will indicate forces acting on each atom with green arrows. These illustrate the direction and amount of force. When a molecule is close to its optimum geometry, the arrows will become small enough to vanish.
