The hydrogen bonding display will dynamically compute hydrogen-bonding interactions.

**Note:** Since the bonding is determined dynamically, large proteins or other large systems will be slow. Optimization and caching is intended for future versions.

Future work will also allow configuration of the pattern matching used to determine bonding sets.



-   Width controls the thickness of the displayed bond.
-   Cut-off radius will consider donor-hydrogen-acceptor sets within this distance.
-   Cut-off angle will consider donor-hydrogen-acceptor sets within this constraint.
